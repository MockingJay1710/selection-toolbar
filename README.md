# Selection Toolbar

Selection Toolbar adds a compact floating toolbar to Obsidian whenever text is selected in the Markdown editor. Use it to format Markdown, convert selected lines into blocks or lists, and extract selected text into a new note without breaking your writing flow.

## Features

- Floating toolbar that appears only when editor text is selected.
- Inline formatting for bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, highlight, inline code, wikilinks, and Markdown links.
- Block formatting for quotes, bullet lists, numbered lists, task lists, fenced code blocks, and callouts.
- Text transforms for uppercase, lowercase, and title case.
- Extract selected text into a new note and replace the selection with a wikilink.
- Keyboard-bindable commands for every toolbar action.
- Blank-line-aware formatting: paragraphs separated by blank lines are formatted independently, while soft line breaks inside a paragraph stay together.

## Usage

Select text in a Markdown note. The toolbar appears near the selection with quick actions:

- **B**: bold
- **I**: italic
- **U**: underline
- **S**: strikethrough
- **H**: highlight
- **`**: inline code
- **[[**: wikilink
- **Link**: Markdown link
- **...**: more actions

The **...** menu contains block, callout, case conversion, and extract-to-note actions.

## Commands

All actions are registered as Obsidian commands so they can be assigned keyboard shortcuts in **Settings -> Hotkeys**.

- Format selection: bold
- Format selection: italic
- Format selection: underline
- Format selection: strikethrough
- Format selection: highlight
- Format selection: inline code
- Format selection: wikilink
- Format selection: link
- Format selection: comment
- Format selection: quote block
- Format selection: bullet list
- Format selection: numbered list
- Format selection: task list
- Format selection: code block
- Format selection: note callout
- Format selection: tip callout
- Format selection: warning callout
- Format selection: uppercase
- Format selection: lowercase
- Format selection: title case
- Extract selection to note

## Notes On Formatting

Selection Toolbar uses standard Markdown where possible.

- Underline uses HTML: `<u>selected text</u>`.
- Highlight uses Obsidian Markdown: `==selected text==`.
- Comments use Obsidian Markdown comments: `%%selected text%%`.
- Callouts use Obsidian callout syntax, such as `> [!note]`.

For selections with blank lines, inline wrappers are applied to each paragraph-like block instead of wrapping the whole selection once.

## Release Checklist

1. Update `version` in `manifest.json`.
